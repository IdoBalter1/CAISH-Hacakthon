      topic: "Introduction to Machine Learning",
      question: "What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      options: [
        "Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data",
        "Supervised learning is faster than unsupervised learning",
        "Unsupervised learning always requires more data",
        "There is no difference between them"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Supervised learning learns from labeled examples (input-output pairs), while unsupervised learning discovers patterns in data without labels."

      id: 2,
      topic: "Neural Networks Basics",
      question: "What is the purpose of an activation function in a neural network?",
      options: [
        "To increase the speed of computation",
        "To introduce non-linearity and determine the output of a neuron",
        "To reduce memory usage",
        "To connect different layers"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Activation functions introduce non-linearity to neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns and determine whether a neuron should be activated."

      topic: "Neural Networks Basics",
      question: "What does backpropagation do in neural network training?",
      options: [
        "It forwards data through the network",
        "It calculates gradients and updates weights to minimize the loss function",
        "It increases the learning rate",
        "It removes unnecessary neurons"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Backpropagation is an algorithm that calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to weights and updates them to minimize error."

      id: 4,
      topic: "Deep Learning Applications",
      question: "Which type of neural network is best suited for image recognition tasks?",
      options: [
        "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)",
        "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)",
        "Linear Regression",
        "Decision Tree"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "CNNs are specifically designed for processing pixel data and excel at image recognition tasks due to their convolutional layers that detect spatial patterns."

      id: 5,
      topic: "Model Evaluation and Metrics",
      question: "What does the F1-score represent?",
      options: [
        "The average of precision and recall",
        "The harmonic mean of precision and recall",
        "The sum of precision and recall",
        "The difference between precision and recall"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure that considers both false positives and false negatives."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      topic: "Model Evaluation and Metrics",
      question: "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      options: [
        "When a model performs perfectly on training data",
        "When a model learns training data too well, including noise, resulting in poor generalization",
        "When a model is too simple",
        "When training takes too long"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes the training data including noise and outliers, leading to excellent training performance but poor performance on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      topic: "Deep Learning Applications",
      question: "What is transfer learning?",
      options: [
        "Moving data from one computer to another",
        "Using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a new related task",
        "Training a model from scratch",
        "Converting data formats"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Transfer learning leverages knowledge from a model trained on one task and applies it to a different but related task, reducing training time and data requirements."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      topic: "Introduction to Machine Learning",
      question: "What is a feature in machine learning?",
      options: [
        "A machine learning algorithm",
        "An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon",
        "A type of neural network",
        "A training dataset"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of the data being analyzed, such as age, height, or pixel values in an image."
